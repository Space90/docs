The W20 UI fragment bundles the [UI Grid](http://ui-grid.info/) library which is a pure AngularJS implementation of
a data grid. To add this component to your application just add the `grid` module to the `w20-ui` fragment configuration:

    "resources/w20-ui/w20-ui.w20.json": {
        "modules": {
            "grid": {}
        }
    }

Please refer to the UI Grid documentation for usage.
