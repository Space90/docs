Seed Cache support integrates the JCache API (a.k.a. JSR 107) which allows to interact with compliant caching providers
in a declarative or a programmatic way.

**Implementations are not provided by this support and must be configured depending on your caching solution**.

To enable the cache support in your application, use the following dependency snippet:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.seedstack.seed</groupId>
        <artifactId>seed-cache-support</artifactId>
    </dependency>

JCache specification jar dependency is required as well since Seed cache support doesn't transitively provide this dependency:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>javax.cache</groupId>
        <artifactId>cache-api</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
