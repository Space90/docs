This book is a short, quickly-readable summary and introduction to the fundamentals of DDD; it does not introduce any 
new concepts; it attempts to concisely summarize the essence of what DDD is, drawing mostly Eric Evans' original book, 
as well other sources since published such as Jimmy Nilsson's Applying Domain Driven Design, and various DDD discussion 
forums. The main topics covered in the book include: Building Domain Knowledge, The Ubiquitous Language, Model Driven 
Design, Refactoring Toward Deeper Insight, and Preserving Model Integrity.
