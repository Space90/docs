If you need to create a browser-only Single Page Application, you can use the [Web framework](/docs/w20) independently from
other SeedStack components. This type of application can invoke backend(s) written with any technology through REST
APIs. 

This type of application is composed of static files only which are best served by specialized infrastructure, like 
an optimized Web server or even a Content Delivery Network (CDN). They can also be served as a part of a backend application.


# Creation

...

# Result

If the process is successful, you should see a structure similar to the following:

```plain
- bower_components       <-- Dependencies go here
      
- fragments              <-- Application fragments go here, one per directory
    - ...
    
- bower.json
- index.html             <-- Application master page 
- w20.app.json           <-- Application configuration                   
```
