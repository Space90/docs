# Creation

To create a Java batch project project from scratch, execute the following command:

    mvn org.seedstack:seedstack-maven-plugin:generate-project -Dtype=batch
    
This will invoke the generate-project goal of the SeedStack maven plugin which will select the latest version
of the SeedStack distribution and use its batch Maven archetype. The process is interactive and will ask you a few
questions about the project to be created.

# Result

If the creation process is successful, you should see a unique module similar to the following:

```plain
- mybatch

    Contain the domain layer (if not in its own module), the applicative layer,
    the batch definition along with the related infrastructure and configuration.
```
