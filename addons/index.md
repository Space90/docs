SeedStack modular design and numerous SPI makes it very easy to extend at every level. Although extensions can
take any suitable form, we propose several well-defined types of add-ons that can be easily packaged and shared with
the community.

# Functions

Functions are the highest level of add-ons that you can provide. They encompass the whole stack, backend and frontend. 
They are aimed at providing a complete end-user functionality that can be easily integrated in any SeedStack-based 
application. 


# Java framework supports

This kind of backend add-on is aimed at providing support for a specific technology or concept in the Java framework. Its
role is to detect, configure and manage it as well as making it accessible from application code.

# Web framework themes

Themes are a kind of add-on that can be used in W20 frontends to alter its appearance. They provide the styling, the 
navigation and the global user interface.
