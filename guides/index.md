Guides are detailed pieces of documentation focusing on a specific task or topic. By reading them, you will learn SeedStack
best practices, gain a deeper understanding of the solution and discover advanced features. 

There are two types of guides:
 
* [The task-oriented guides](tasks) which focuses on hands-on instructions to help you achieve a specific task.
* [The design-oriented guides](design) which are documents exploring more general topics which can be applied
to SeedStack-based projects.
